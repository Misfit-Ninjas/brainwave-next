## Problem
The raw idea, a use case, or something we’ve seen that motivates us to work on this

## Appetite
How much time we want to spend and how that constrains the solution

## Solution
The core elements we came up with, presented in a form that’s easy for people to immediately understand

## Rabbit holes
Details about the solution worth calling out to avoid problems

## No-gos
Anything specifically excluded from the concept: functionality or use cases we intentionally aren't covering to fit the appetite or make the problem tractable
